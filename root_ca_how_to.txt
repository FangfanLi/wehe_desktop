Generating a root certificate and keys:

`openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096`

remove -des3 if you don't need a password though i would not recommend this

`openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out ca.crt`

iOS needs a cert in the .der format and a pkcs12 file

`openssl x509 -in ca.crt -outform DER -out ca.der` 

`openssl pkcs12 -export -out ca.pfx -inkey ca.key -in ca.crt`
Note that the export password you set here should NOT be the same as your root key password
The export password will be used in the app along the pfx file
Do not include the root key password in the source code

Distribute the .crt and .key files to each server and use the certGenerator script to generate and renew server specific certs
